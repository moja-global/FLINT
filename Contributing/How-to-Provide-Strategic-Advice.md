## Suggestions for the Strategic Plan:
1. Open a new issue [here](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/issues/new). (If the link does not work: Navigate to the main page of the .github repository. Click "Issues". At the bottom of the page, click "Open a Regular Issue".)
1. Start your title with the word "Strategy:". Then use a clear and descriptive title 
1. Select "Strategy" from the labels drop down menu
1. Propose your strategic target in the body of the Issue. Provide as much detail as possible including effective implementation approaches, potential in-kind or financial support, examples, etc. 
1. Attach files, screenshots and animated GIFs
1. Click the green button "Submit New Issue" at the bottom right corner
