## What is a Project?

A project is discrete piece of work related to the development of code, such as a module or a feature as well as the documentation related to the code. A project requires the contribution of more than 1 person. To smoothen collaboration, some [practical steps](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Start-a-New-Project.md) are proposed to those who want to implement a project.


## Types of Projects

There are two types of projects:



1. **Strategy Initiated**: Every year moja global develops a [strategic plan](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Governance/Strategic-Plan.md). The plan contains various projects. Anybody can [propose ideas for the strategic plan](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Provide-Strategic-Advice.md). The Strategy Board prioritises and approves the plan and then tries to [mobilize the necessary resources]() to implement the projects. Anybody can [join these projects](). 
2. **User Initiated:**  As a user, you can start a project that is important to you. You can [submit a project idea]() anytime. The idea of the project might come from your own need / preference or it might be an issue that was already listed on the issue backlog of a repository but that needs the contribution of several persons. In either case, thank you for [starting a moja global project](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Start-a-New-Project.md).
