## [Unreleased on master]
**Note:** Ideally this section wouldn't exist. Rather, unreleased work would live on `develop` and any commits to `master` would create a (probably minor) version bump. See [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for details or [A successful branching policy](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for motivation.

### Added
- New ['How to use FLINT' guides](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT/tree/master/How_to_use_FLINT) by [@GeoffRoberts](https://github.com/GeoffRoberts)
- [`fmt`](https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html) library for improved output formatting.
- New TIFF reader for importing spatial data from [@mfellows](https://github.com/mfellows) and
[@mal](https://github.com/malfrancis). The GDAL raster reader now supports all data types and resolutions; testing with large simulations confirms that results are identical to the custom tile/block/cell format.

### Changed
- Updated LICENSE by [@gmajan](https://github.com/gmajan)
- Update README
- Configured SQLite to explicitly read-only / no-mutex to improve read-only performance
